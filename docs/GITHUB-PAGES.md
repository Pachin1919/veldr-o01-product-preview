# GitHub Pages delivery

Source Lovable revision: ff7cadd51d4a3931500751649b3937c958b63875.

The reviewed React/TanStack route content and interactions are retained. Hosting is adapted to a static Vite browser app; the server wrapper and platform error-reporting transport are excluded. Repository base path is /veldr-o01-product-preview/. Every known detail route gets a physical index.html for direct entry and refresh.

Artwork is self-hosted. Chinese fonts are optimized for current authored copy and self-hosted as portable WOFF2 with existing OFL notices. Regenerate after changing Chinese copy. The CHROMA platform-only font pointer is removed.

Build: npm install, then npm run build. The Pages workflow installs the declared existing frontend dependencies and deploys only dist. No backend, API, login, database or runtime remote asset service is required.

Publication QA will be recorded in docs/PUBLICATION-QA.md.
